Assignment 1: Compound Interest with Total Amount

Write a program which takes 3 inputs from user as:

* Principal amount (int)
* Rate of annual interest (float)
* Total tenure (in years)

Formula:
Amount = Principal * (1 + rate/100) ** tenure

Example:
principal = 100
interest = 8
tenure = 2
Then amount = 100 * 1.08 * 1.08 = 116.64

Solution:

principal = int(input("Enter the principal amount: "))
rate = float(input("Enter the annual interest rate (%): "))
tenure = int(input("Enter the tenure in years: "))

amount = principal * ((1 + rate / 100) ** tenure)
print("Total amount after", tenure, "years is:", round(amount, 2))

Assignment 2: Odd or Even

Ask the user to enter a number. Print whether the number is even or odd.

Solution:

num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

if num % 2 == 0:
print("Even Number")
else:
print("Odd Number")

Assignment 3: Age Group Checker

Ask the user to enter their age.
If age is:

* less than 13 → print "Child"
* between 13 and 19 → print "Teenager"
* 20 or more → print "Adult"

Solution:

age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

if age < 13:
print("Child")
elif age <= 19:
print("Teenager")
else:
print("Adult")

Assignment 4: Simple Login System

Create two variables:
username = "admin"
password = "1234"

Ask the user to input username and password.
If both match, print “Login successful”, else “Invalid credentials”.

Solution:

username = "admin"
password = "1234"

entered_username = input("Enter username: ")
entered_password = input("Enter password: ")

if entered_username == username and entered_password == password:
print("Login successful")
else:
print("Invalid credentials")

Assignment 5: Find the Largest Number

Ask the user to enter three numbers a, b, c
Print the largest among them.

Solution:

a = int(input("Enter first number: "))
b = int(input("Enter second number: "))
c = int(input("Enter third number: "))

if a >= b and a >= c:
print("Largest number is:", a)
elif b >= a and b >= c:
print("Largest number is:", b)
else:
print("Largest number is:", c)

Assignment 6: Temperature Converter

Ask the user to enter temperature in Celsius
Convert it to Fahrenheit using the formula:
Fahrenheit = (Celsius × 9/5) + 32
Print the result like: "37°C is equal to 98.6°F"

Solution:

celsius = float(input("Enter temperature in Celsius: "))
fahrenheit = (celsius * 9 / 5) + 32

print(f"{celsius}°C is equal to {fahrenheit}°F")

---

Assignment 7: Number Type Checker

Ask the user to input a number.
Print whether it is:

* Positive
* Negative
* Zero

Solution:

num = float(input("Enter a number: "))

if num > 0:
print("Positive number")
elif num < 0:
print("Negative number")
else:
print("Zero")

---

Assignment 8: Password Strength Checker

Ask the user to enter a password.
If the password is:

* Less than 6 characters → print "Weak Password"
* 6–10 characters → print "Moderate Password"
* More than 10 characters → print "Strong Password"

Use len() function to get password length.

Solution:

password = input("Enter your password: ")
length = len(password)

if length < 6:
print("Weak Password")
elif length <= 10:
print("Moderate Password")
else:
print("Strong Password")

---

Assignment 9: Leap Year Checker

Ask the user to enter a year.
Print whether it is a leap year or not.

Leap year rules:

* Year must be divisible by 4
* Not divisible by 100 unless also divisible by 400

Solution:

year = int(input("Enter a year: "))

if (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0) or (year % 400 == 0):
print("Leap year")
else:
print("Not a leap year")

---

Assignment 10: Bill Splitter with Tip

Ask the user to input:

* Total bill amount
* Tip percentage (e.g., 10 for 10%)
* Number of people

Calculate:

* Tip amount = (bill × tip %) / 100
* Total amount = bill + tip
* Per person share = total amount / number of people

Print all three values clearly.

Example Output:
Tip: ₹100.0
Total Bill (with tip): ₹1100.0
Each person should pay: ₹275.0

Solution:

bill = float(input("Enter total bill amount: "))
tip_percent = float(input("Enter tip percentage: "))
people = int(input("Enter number of people: "))

tip = (bill * tip_percent) / 100
total = bill + tip
per_person = total / people

print("Tip: ₹", round(tip, 2))
print("Total Bill (with tip): ₹", round(total, 2))
print("Each person should pay: ₹", round(per_person, 2))
